# Room: Linux Fundamentals Part 2  
**Platform:** TryHackMe  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Date Completed:** 4th October 2025  

## üóíÔ∏è Room Summary
In this room, I got deeper into Linux and learned a lot of practical stuff. I studied how SSH works to connect securely to another computer, how flags and switches can change the behavior of commands, and how to manage files using commands like `rm`, `mv`, and `cp`. I also explored Linux file permissions and the common directories that are important in every Linux system.  

## üîë Key Takeaways
- SSH (Secure Shell) is used to connect to other machines securely over the network.  
- Flags and switches are extra options in commands (like `ls -l` or `ls -a`) that give more details.  
- File commands I practiced:  
  - `rm` ‚Üí delete files or folders.  
  - `mv` ‚Üí move or rename files.  
  - `cp` ‚Üí copy files.  
- File permissions are shown as `rwx` and decide who can read, write, or run a file.  
- Common directories I learned:  
  - `/home` for user files.  
  - `/etc` for configuration files.  
  - `/var` for logs.    

## üñ•Ô∏è Practical Learning
I used SSH to connect to another machine, experimented with copying and moving files, and checked out file permissions with the `ls -l` command. This helped me actually see how Linux controls access to files and why permissions are so important.

## Why this matters
All of this is the kind of stuff you do daily in Linux. Knowing these basics makes it easier to work with servers, secure systems, and even prepare for more advanced cybersecurity work. It‚Äôs the real foundation.
