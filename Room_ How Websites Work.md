## 🗒️ Room Summary
This room helped me understand the basic structure of websites and how browsers load them. I learnt about how user based input cannot be trusted because they can Inject malicious code like HTML Injection, I'll learn DATABASE INJECTION in a later room in TryHackMe.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways
- Websites are built using three main languages:  
  - **HTML** → The structure and content.  
  - **CSS** → The style and design.  
  - **JavaScript** → The interactivity and logic.  
- HTML Injection:
  - How people can inject JS and HTML in a website.
  - This means VERNABILITY. 

## 🖥️ Practical Learning
I explored how a browser requests HTML, then loads CSS and JavaScript to build the full page.  
I also looked at the difference between static vs dynamic pages, and understood how back-end servers and databases power modern web apps.  

## 📸 Some Screenshots
- Example of HTML structure in a page:

- How I applied javascript in source code of the webpage:

- HTML INJECTIONN:

## 🌍 Why This Matters
Knowing how websites work is essential before diving into web security. If I don’t know how websites are built, I can’t fully understand how attackers exploit them or how to defend them. This room gave me the fundamentals that connect directly to cybersecurity concepts.
