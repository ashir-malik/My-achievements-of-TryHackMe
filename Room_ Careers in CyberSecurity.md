## 🔑 Key Learnings

This room gave me a solid introduction to the different career paths in cybersecurity. It wasn’t about hacking or tools, it is more about understanding what jobs exist in the field and what each role actually does. It helped me get a better idea of where I might fit in.

Some key takeaways:
- Cybersecurity isn’t just one job, it is a whole network of a wide range of roles, both technical and investigative.
- Every role plays a part in protecting systems, responding to incidents, or understanding threats.
- You don’t need to know everything. Each job has a specific focus and skill set.

## 📝 Personal Notes

I liked that this room didn’t assume you already knew what you wanted to do. It just laid out the options clearly and let you think about what might suit you best. For me, it made me realize how much I enjoy the offensive and defensive side of security, like pentester, security engineer, red teamer, malware and security analyst.

It also made it clear that cybersecurity isn’t only about offensive work or hacking. There’s a lot of value in defensive and analytical roles too.

Definitely a good room if you're just starting out or trying to figure out your direction in this field.
