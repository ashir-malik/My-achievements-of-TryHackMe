## üóíÔ∏èRoom Summary  
This TryHackMe room explained the seven layers of the OSI model. I learnt how each layer works step by step to make communication possible between two devices. It gave me a clear structure to understand where protocols, hardware, and applications fit in networking.  

## üîëKey Takeaways  
The OSI model has 7 layers.  
- The Physical layer is about cables, signals, and actual hardware.  
- The Data Link layer is about MAC addresses and how devices talk inside the same network.  
- The Network layer uses IP addresses and makes routing possible.  
- The Transport layer handles reliable (TCP) or fast (UDP) delivery of data.  
- The Session layer manages the connection between two devices.  
- The Presentation layer takes care of formatting, compression, and encryption.  
- The Application layer is what we use daily like web browsers and email.  

## üñ•Ô∏èPractical Learning  
I matched common tools and protocols with the right OSI layer.  
For example:  
- HTTP belongs to the Application layer.  
- TCP and UDP are part of the Transport layer.  
- Routers work at the Network layer.  
- Switches are at the Data Link layer.  

This made the abstract concept easier to remember.

## Why the OSI model matters  
The OSI model is important because it helps to troubleshoot networking issues layer by layer. It also gives me a clear way to organize protocols and tools in my mind, which is very useful in cybersecurity.
