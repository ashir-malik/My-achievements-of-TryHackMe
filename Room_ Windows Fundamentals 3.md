## üîë Key Takeaways  
- **Windows Updates:** I learnt that regular updates don‚Äôt just add new features but also they fix bugs and protect against new security threats.  
- **Windows Security Center:** It‚Äôs the main place where you can see your system‚Äôs security health such as antivirus, firewall, and etc.  
- **Virus & Threat Protection:** Windows Defender constantly scans for malware and keeps the system safe in real time.  
- **Firewall & Network Protection:** Helps block suspicious traffic and keeps hackers from accessing the computer.  
- **App & Browser Control:** SmartScreen warns if a website or downloaded file could be unsafe.  
- **Device Security:** Focuses on hardware-level protection like TPM and Secure Boot to prevent deep system attacks.  
- **BitLocker:** Encrypts the drive so that even if someone steals the laptop, they can‚Äôt access the data.  
- **Volume Shadow Copy:** I found this feature really smart bcz it automatically creates system backups that can restore files if something goes wrong.
